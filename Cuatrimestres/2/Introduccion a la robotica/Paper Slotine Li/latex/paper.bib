@article{Slotine1988,
abstract = {The author's previous work (1986, 1987) utilized the particular structure of manipulator dynamics to develop a simple, globally convergent adaptive controller for manipulator trajectory control problems. After summarizing the basic algorithm, they demonstrate the approach on a high-speed two-degree-of-freedom semi-direct-drive robot. They show that the dynamic parameters of the manipulator, assumed to be initially unknown, can be estimated within the first half second of a typical run, and that accordingly, the manipulator trajectory can be precisely controlled. These experimental results demonstrate that the adaptive controller enjoys essentially the same level of robustness to unmodeled dynamics as a PD (proportional and differential) controller, yet achieves much better tracking accuracy than either PD or computed-torque schemes. Its superior performance for high-speed operations, in the presence of parametric and nonparametric uncertainties, and its relative computational simplicity, make it an attractive option both for addressing complex industrial tasks, and for simplifying high-level programming of more standard operations},

@article{Moctezuma2011,
abstract = {This paper proposes a parameter identification methodology based on a discrete-time Least Squares algorithm and a parametrization obtained using the Operational Calculus. References [4] and [5] proposed previously this parametrization and developed an Algebraic Identification Method (AIM) for parameter estimation of linear systems. The AIM employs the Operational Calculus to obtain analytical expressions for the parameter estimates. These expressions have a singularity at t=0 and certain excitation signals may also produce singularities at other time instants. The proposed approach employs the same parametrization obtained using the Operational Calculus, which is linear in the parameters, and employs a standard on-line discrete-time Least Squares algorithm. In this way, the proposed approach completely eliminates the problem of singularities; moreover, it is experimentally shown that the AIM and the proposed approach have similar performances.},
